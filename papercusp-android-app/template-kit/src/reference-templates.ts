/**
 * Reference template manifests — the retro-fitted proof that the
 * template.yaml schema + composition semantics describe REALITY
 * (plan app-templates-2026-07-04 P-005 + P-014).
 *
 * P-014's recommended realization (owner directive: one app = a composition
 * of MANY templates) splits template #1 three ways, extracted from what the
 * two internal reference apps actually are:
 *
 *   - PAPERCUSP_OPS_HIVES_TEMPLATE   (aspect) — the app-owned agentic
 *     plan/work-item execution plane + the ONE seam. Carries both Tier B
 *     components.
 *   - TAURI_DESKTOP_SHELL_TEMPLATE   (aspect) — the app chassis: the
 *     deterministic plane's host stack + release pipeline.
 *   - AGENTIC_DESKTOP_APP_TEMPLATE   (app)    — a THIN pure composition (no
 *     own components; the P-014 schema rule allows this exactly for non-empty
 *     composesWith). P-022 re-layered it: it now requires the non-agentic
 *     DESKTOP_APP_TEMPLATE as its BASE app (which pulls the shell + data +
 *     UI closure) and layers PAPERCUSP_OPS_HIVES on top.
 *
 * These are DRAFTS of the shippable templates: P-006 writes the GUIDE.md +
 * starter blueprints + contract templates around them, P-007 makes checks/
 * real, and P-013 (consumer #1) re-materializes its agentic plane
 * from them. The suite validates each standalone, as a set
 * (validateTemplateSet), composed (composeTemplates — the union-of-checks),
 * and against COMPONENT_CATALOG, so catalog drift breaks this file loudly
 * (the P-009 gym re-runs the same validation).
